### Projects I've worked on
### Securing a Web-Based Password Manager
*Jan – Mar 2025*  
Deployed a full-stack password manager as a honeypot to simulate real attacks, then hardened it from the ground up.  

**What I built & broke:**  
- Exposed and mitigated SQL injection, XSS, brute-force logins, weak auth, and broken access controls  
- Implemented end-to-end encryption (data-in-transit & at-rest) using cryptographic best practices  
- Added anomaly detection via secure logging and monitoring for suspicious activity  

**Tech stack:** Python (backend), HTML/CSS/JS (frontend), SQL, cryptography libs, OWASP ZAP for testing  
**Impact:** Turned a vulnerable app into a production-ready, secure system-lessons directly applied to my AI web-browsing evaluations.

### DAST Tool Comparison: OWASP ZAP vs. Nikto
*Jan – Mar 2025*  
Head-to-head battle of two dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools against a deliberately vulnerable web app.  

**What I tested:**  
- Scanned for XSS, SQLi, outdated software, and 20+ other vulns  
- Analyzed scan coverage, false positives, report clarity, and usability  
- Benchmarked real-world effectiveness in a controlled environment  

**Tech stack:** OWASP ZAP, Nikto, Burp Suite (for manual verification), Python for automation scripts, vulnerable DVWA app  
**Impact:** Created a decision framework for teams choosing DAST tools-now part of my toolkit for LLM security audits.  

**[Report](coming soon)**

### SilverGuard
*Jan - Jun 2026*
More details coming soon
